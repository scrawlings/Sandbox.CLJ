Sandbox.CLJ
===================

As part of a larger plan of studies I'm striving to learn Clojure, (learn, not merely be aquainted with).


Translating parts of ThinkComplexity 
------------------------------------

Translation of code examples into Clojure from the original Python given in the book Think Clojure by Downey

The free creative commons text can be found here: http://www.greenteapress.com/compmod/ or you can buy it from http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920022480.do


Exercises and examples from Clojure Programming
-----------------------------------------------

I rather like the scope and style of this book, (http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920013754.do). 

Sometimes it leaves me dumbstruck how a good abstraction can make short work of things that hard in other languages. There are some great non-trivial examples in the book.


N.B. there may be JavaScipt
---------------------------

I may make things into web servers and use JavaScript for monitoring and visualisation. Some of the bigger projects in the study I'm undertaking revolve around distributed computing and frankly web based tools are easy. I'm here to learn not for self-flagellation.
